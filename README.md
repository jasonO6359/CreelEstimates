# CreelPointEstimate

Estimation of freshwater fishery catch and effort using roving-roving creel designs and following established methods (e.g., Hahn, Pollock).

[*fw_creel_pe.Rmd*](https://github.com/wdfw-fp/CreelPointEstimate/blob/main/fw_creel_pe.Rmd) is a parameterized Rmarkdown script that
 - fetches electronically collected observations from public views of the statewide freshwater creel database [published at data.wa.gov](https://data.wa.gov/browse?q=creel))
 - wrangles intermediary objects and calculates estimates by expanding angler interview data according to index counts bias-corrected by census counts
 - presents various figures and tables and allows export of an Excel workbook compiling the data, intermediates and estimates
